## 🚀 How to Use

### Simplest Possible Usage

```python
from fdqc_ai import FDQC_AI

ai = FDQC_AI()
ai.think("Hello world")
ai.learn(reward=0.8)
ai.introspect()
```

### Complete Workflow

```python
# 1. Create AI
ai = FDQC_AI(name="MyAI", verbose=True)

# 2. Process inputs
for experience in experiences:
    result = ai.think(experience)
    
    # 3. Provide feedback
    reward = evaluate(result)
    ai.learn(reward=reward)
    
    # 4. Make decisions
    action = ai.decide()
    
    # 5. Retrieve memories
    memories = ai.remember("relevant query")

# 6. Analyze results
stats = ai.get_statistics()
ai.introspect()

# 7. Visualize
from utils.visualization import visualize_all
visualize_all(ai, output_dir="results")
```
